RotaryBoard
===========

RotaryBoard is a small piece of AVR-powered hardware that contains a bunch of
rotary encoders with LEDs and buttons. All events are sent via the UART to
another device, usually a PC, which then acts on them and controls the LEDs on
the board.

Its purpose is to control various volumes on my PC using hardware buttons since
that is usually much nicer and faster than doing it using a GUI on the PC.
